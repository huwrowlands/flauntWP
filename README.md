Using Todd Motto's Flaunt.js responsive menu for WordPress. Modified slightly to work with WordPress custom menu's, please feel free to point out any bugs and/or fixes for improvements.

Make sure your WordPress Custom Menu has this line in the functions.php code: 

'items_wrap'      => '<ul class="nav-list">%3$s</ul>'
